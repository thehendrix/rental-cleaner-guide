# Rental Cleaner Guide

This is an application to help cleaners maintain rental properties. It also serves as a way for the owner and interested parties to be aware of things such as items that need to be restocked or any repairs that need attention. The goal with this application is to improve communication, reduce time for handling issues, and have a more streamlined workflow.
